## Status
- Status: alpha
- Currently undergoing some major resturcturing.
- Attempting to get the doc generator working.

## Goals
* Ease of modification.  Due to Lua's dynamic nature it's possible to
  overwrite any Solstice function, allowing you to customize every
  aspect of the system.
* Previous goal of allowing combat/effect Lua replacements has been
  ditched in favor of C++ NWNX plugins.
  
## Dependencies
* Luajit 2.0 
* luafilesystem
* nwnx_effects
* nwnx_combat
* nwnx_nsevents
* nwnx_nschat
