## NWScript Differences
* Solstice 'scripts' are not files.  Instead they are functions in the
  global namespace.
* There is no concept of OBJECT_SELF, this is passed explicitly.
* Solstice is a more object oriented framework.  e.g. rather than
  SendMessageToPC(pc, "Hello") in Solstice it would be
  pc:SendMessage("Hello").
* Solstice uses Luajit and its Foreign Function Interface (FFI) library.
  Therefore all game objects, data, etc are trivially accessible and any C
  library is trivial to import and use.  Some care naturally has to be
  taken since Luajit's FFI does not protect you, if you pass bad data
  into C your server _will_ segfault. General scripting with Solstice
  doesn't require any knowledge of C however.
