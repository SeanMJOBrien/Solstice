Currently doing some major restructuring.  


# Combat Engine Differences

* Concealment in the combat log is the modified amount, as in nwnx_defenses.
* All weapon damages stack rather then using only the highest applying damage.
* Monster Damage is usable on all weapons.  When used it overrides the base weapon damage.
